# generator-collector
> :recycle: Lazily collect and query generators in JS
---

> :warning: This project is **experimental** and should not be considered stable for production use.

## Features

- Collect and query generator results using coroutines
- Iterate only to the values you need, only when you need them
- Seamless integration with promises and async functions

## Resources

- :book: [Documentation](https://slurmulon.github.io/generator-collector)
- :anchor: [Install](https://slurmulon.github.io/generator-collector/#/install)
- :wrench: [API](https://slurmulon.github.io/generator-collector/#/api/)
- :bulb: [Usage and Examples](https://slurmulon.github.io/generator-collector/#/usage)

## Example

The following example is the output of a [blackjack engine](https://github.com/slurmulon/generator-collector/blob/main/examples/blackjack/index.mjs) written using `generator-collector`.

It implements a state machine based on asynchronous coroutines, allowing it to run many blackjack games lazily, cooperatively and concurrently!

- Emoji players (:skull:) are in one game, `P` players are in another and üí∏ is the dealer in both.
- The result of each game is logged with the `[play:round]` prefix.
- Random timeouts are added between player turns to give the effect of real gameplay.
