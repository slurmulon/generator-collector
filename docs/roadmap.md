# Roadmap
---

This project was created purely for experimental purposes and self-education. Unless it gains wider interest and adoption, the interface will be largely influenced by own needs and use cases.

In any case, I fully intend to make this solution applicable to a wide variety of situations.
My primary goal is to provide JS developers a painless way to utilize generators in their promise-flavored projects.

The following is a list of planned and improvements and ideas:

 - [ ] TypeScript
 - [ ] CJS and UMD builds
 - [ ] Support infinite generators by allowing a scope/limit to be provided
 - [ ] Allow `entity` to be configured with the values types it should recursively resolve
